# Goal of this Project
This project was created to help lower the barrier to entry for playing Dungeons & Dragons. Getting into DnD can be expensive, especially if you buy all the official books, maps, and miniatures. To make the game more accessible, I developed a free program that lets players share and interact with maps online. Itâ€™s a great tool for remote groups and anyone looking to enjoy one of my favorite hobbies without the high cost.
